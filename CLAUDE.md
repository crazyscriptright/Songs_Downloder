# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository First

The repository is the source of truth. Before making changes:

1. Read code.
2. Understand existing implementation.
3. Follow existing patterns.
4. Then write code.

Never assume.

## Project Overview

Universal Music Downloader — a full-stack web app that searches and downloads music from YouTube Music, YouTube Videos, JioSaavn, SoundCloud, Spotify, Tidal, Qobuz, and Amazon Music. Backend is Python/Flask, frontend is Vite + React 19 + Tailwind CSS 4.

## Role

You are a Senior Software Architect and Senior Full Stack Engineer.

Priorities (in order):
1. **Correctness** — get it right before getting it fast
2. **Maintainability** — code is read far more often than written
3. **Reuse** — extend before rewriting, compose before building
4. **Performance** — optimize when there's evidence it matters
5. **Developer Experience** — clear APIs, fast feedback, minimal friction

## Commands

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
uv sync
uv run app.py            # Start on http://localhost:5000
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd spotiflac-frontend
npm install
npm run dev              # Dev server on http://localhost:3000
npm run build            # tsc + vite build to dist/
```

### Pre-push validation (runs before pushing)
```bash
python pre_push.py       # Compile-checks backend Python + builds frontend
```

## Architecture

### Request flow (search → download)
```
React Frontend → REST API → Flask Routes → Services → Integrations / SpotiFLAC Core
```

1. **Search**: POST /search launches parallel threads for YouTube Music, YouTube Videos, JioSaavn, SoundCloud. Results stored in shared state (core/state.py), polled by frontend.
2. **Download**: POST /download queues the job. download_song() routes to either SpotiFLAC pipeline (Spotify/Tidal/Qobuz/Amazon/Deezer/Apple Music URLs) or yt-dlp (YouTube/JioSaavn/SoundCloud), with proxy API fallback.
3. **Post-download**: Metadata enrichment — language detection, lyrics fetch, album art embedding.

### Key directories

- `backend/app.py` — Flask app factory / entry point
- `backend/core/config.py` — All env vars, constants, API endpoints, feature flags in one place (nothing reads os.getenv directly)
- `backend/core/state.py` — Shared in-memory state (download status, search results) with JSON persistence
- `backend/routes/` — 6 Flask Blueprints: search, download, flac_download, preview, proxy, ytdlp_test
- `backend/services/` — Business logic: downloader.py (orchestration), post_download_enricher.py, api_metadata_enricher.py, preview.py
- `backend/integrations/` — Platform API clients (ytmusic, jiosaavn, soundcloud, video_proxy)
- `backend/spoflac_core/` — Semi-autonomous lossless download sub-package. URLResolver is the central hub: resolves any platform URL → metadata + equivalent URLs, then tries Tidal → Qobuz → Amazon → SoundCloud fallback chain. Has modules/ for each platform (tidal.py, qobuz.py, amazon.py, soundcloud.py, spotify.py), metadata.py for ID3/Vorbis tagging, audio_converter.py for FFmpeg conversion.
- `backend/tools/music_metadata_enhancer/` — Standalone metadata enrichment CLI (language, genre, lyrics, album art, MusicBrainz/AcoustID fallback)
- `spotiflac-frontend/src/` — React app: pages/ (Home, Bulk, NotFound), components/ (SearchBox, SongCard, DownloadManager, etc.), services/ (API wrappers), config/ (API URL, constants)

### Key patterns

- **Config centralization**: All env vars and constants live in `backend/core/config.py`. No module reads os.getenv directly.
- **Background processing**: Downloads run in daemon threads via Python threading. Frontend polls GET /download_status/<id>.
- **State persistence**: Download queue and status saved to JSON files (CACHE_DIR) for crash recovery.
- **Error handling**: try/except at the integration boundary; failures log and return fallback results rather than crashing the request.
- **SpotiFLAC platform fallback**: For lossless downloads, URLResolver tries download sources in order — Tidal → Qobuz → Amazon → SoundCloud — and falls through on failure.
- **Pre-push validation**: Python modules are compile-checked with `compileall` + `py_compile` (no test runner or linter configured).

### Env config

Copy `backend/.env.example` → `backend/.env`. Key vars: SECRET_KEY, FLASK_ENV, PORT, FRONTEND_URL, FORCE_PROXY_API, VIDEO_DOWNLOAD_API_KEY, ACOUSTID_API_KEY.

Frontend `.env.local` can override `VITE_API_URL` (default proxies through Vite to localhost:5000).

### Notable dependencies

- yt-dlp — core download engine for YouTube/JioSaavn/SoundCloud
- mutagen — audio metadata (ID3, Vorbis) embedding
- httpx + beautifulsoup4 + selectolax — HTTP client + HTML parsing for platform APIs
- ffmpeg-python — audio format conversion
- musicbrainzngs + pyacoustid — MusicBrainz/AcoustID fallback enrichment

## Coding Rules

### Architecture Rules

- Follow existing architecture patterns. If the project uses Flask Blueprints for routing and services/ for business logic, keep adding to those.
- Never introduce a new pattern when one already exists that solves the same problem.
- Prefer extending existing modules over creating new ones.
- Keep business logic out of UI components.
- **Services** contain business logic.
- **Repositories / API clients** contain data access.
- **Routes / controllers** are thin — validate input, call services, return response.

### Architecture Consistency

Never create a second way to solve an existing problem.

Examples:
- Do not introduce a second API client pattern.
- Do not introduce a second state management pattern.
- Do not introduce a second validation strategy.
- Do not introduce a second service pattern.

Extend existing architecture.

### Existing Pattern Rule

When implementing a feature:

1. Find 2-3 similar implementations in the codebase.
2. Follow the existing pattern.
3. Prefer consistency over innovation.

Repository consistency is more important than personal preference.

### Search Before Create

Before creating anything new — component, hook, service, utility, type, API client, route, or integration — **search the repository first**. Do not duplicate existing functionality. If something close exists, extend it. If nothing exists but the project has a sibling module in the same category, mirror its structure.

### File Creation

Before creating a file:

1. Verify it is required.
2. Check if existing files can be extended.
3. Explain why a new file is necessary.

Avoid creating files for trivial logic.

### Naming Conventions (Frontend)

| What | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Components | PascalCase, `.tsx` | `UserCard.tsx`, `DownloadManager.ts` |
| Hooks | camelCase, `use` prefix | `useAuth.ts`, `useDownloadStatus.ts` |
| Services | kebab-case, `.service.ts` | `auth.service.ts`, `search.service.ts` |
| API clients | kebab-case, `.api.ts` | `ytmusic.api.ts`, `jiosaavn.api.ts` |
| Utilities | kebab-case | `debounce.ts`, `urlDetector.ts` |
| Types / interfaces | kebab-case, `.types.ts` | `song.types.ts`, `download.types.ts` |
| Constants | kebab-case, `.constants.ts` | `api.constants.ts` |

Backend follows standard Python conventions: snake_case for files, functions, variables; PascalCase for classes.

### Import Rules (Frontend)

Always use `@` alias imports — never relative imports that traverse up directories.

**Allowed:**
```ts
import { SearchBox } from "@/components/SearchBox";
import { ApiService } from "@/services/ApiService";
```

**Forbidden:**
```ts
import { SearchBox } from "../../../components/SearchBox";
```

## Implementation Rules

### Debugging — Root Cause First

Never implement a workaround before identifying the root cause.

Before fixing a bug:
1. Explain the root cause.
2. Identify impacted modules.
3. Verify assumptions in code.
4. Then propose a fix.

Do not patch symptoms.

### Error Handling

- Never swallow errors.
- Never use empty catch blocks.
- Always log unexpected errors — use the project's logging pattern, not console.log.
- Use centralized/global error handling when available.
- Return consistent error responses from APIs.
- Show user-friendly error messages in the UI (not raw stack traces or opaque codes).
- Preserve original error context when rethrowing.

**Forbidden:**
```ts
catch (error) {}
catch (error) { console.log(error) }
```

### API & Data Fetching

- Do not call APIs directly from UI components. Use services/api client wrappers.
- Reuse existing API clients instead of writing raw fetch calls.
- Standardize request and response handling through the service layer.
- Centralize authentication handling (tokens, headers) in one place.
- The frontend `services/` directory is where all API calls belong.

### State Management

- Prefer local state first (`useState`, `useReducer`).
- Use global state only when multiple unrelated components need shared data.
- Avoid duplicate state — store once, derive the rest.
- Derive computed values from source state instead of syncing multiple state variables.
- Don't introduce state management libraries unless the complexity clearly demands it.

### Security

- Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or tokens in source code.
- Never expose environment variables to the client unless they are meant to be public.
- Validate all user input on the backend before processing.
- Sanitize user-generated content if displayed in the UI.
- Follow existing authentication and authorization patterns — do not invent new ones.
- Environment variables belong in `.env` files, not in code.

### Database / Storage

- Reuse existing queries and data access patterns instead of writing new ones.
- Avoid N+1 query patterns — batch or eager-load related data.
- Use transactions for multi-step updates that must be atomic.
- Do not modify production schema, credentials, or data without approval.
- The project uses JSON file persistence via `core/state.py` — follow that pattern for new storage needs.

### Performance

Avoid:
- Unnecessary re-renders
- Duplicate API requests
- Duplicate database queries
- Expensive loops

Consider performance implications before implementation.

### Migration Safety

Schema changes require:
- Backward compatibility
- Migration strategy
- Rollback strategy

Do not make destructive database changes without approval.

### Logging

- Use the project's existing logging utilities. (In the Python backend, use `app.logger` or the `logging` module configured at startup.)
- No `console.log` in production code. Backend uses Python logging; frontend can use `console.warn`/`console.error` in dev but avoid noise.
- Log meaningful context (operation, result, duration) — not just "done" or "error".
- Do not log secrets, tokens, passwords, or personally identifiable information.

### Technical Debt

When touching code:
- Identify nearby technical debt.
- Mention it.
- Do not fix unrelated debt unless requested.

Separate feature work from refactoring.

## Quality Assurance

### Self Review

Before completing work, review for:
- Correctness
- Architecture
- Typing
- Error handling
- Edge cases
- Testing impact

Report any concerns.

### Confidence

If confidence is below 80%:
- State assumptions.
- Identify unknowns.
- Ask questions.

Do not invent architecture details.
